Our Budget Buddy app has a streamlined front page where users can view their current balance, total income and total expenses, along with recent transactions. 

Key features include the ability to add, edit and delete transactions, categorize expenses by type, adding notes, dates, and even uploading a picture of a receipt.

The app also offers summary reports for better financial insights. Itâ€™s designed to give users full control over their daily finances, including cash and card transactions in a simple, efficient way.
